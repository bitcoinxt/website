        info: |
            Bitcoin XT is a full node implementation of a Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC). Bitcoin XT embraces Bitcoin's original vision of simple, reliable, low-cost transactions for everyone in the world. Bitcoin XT originated as a series of patches on top of Bitcoin Core and is now a independently maintained software fork. We do <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinxt/gitian.sigs">deterministic builds</a> so anyone can check the downloads correspond to the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt">source code</a>.

    whatwestandfor:
        title: "What we stand for"
        missionstatement: |
            The XT mission statement defines what the project believes is important: commitment to these principles are what differentiates us from Bitcoin Core. We try to follow Satoshi's original vision, as it is that vision which brought the Bitcoin community together.
        scaling: |
            <b>Scaling the network up to handle user demand is important</b>, even if that means the network changes along the way. <a href="http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/" title="Satoshi Nakamoto Institute - Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper">It's what Satoshi wanted</a> and the idea of a global system used by ordinary people is what motivated many of us to join him.
        provideinfo: |
            <b>XT provides people with information they need</b>, even if using it requires them to make risk based decisions. For example:
        zeroconf: |
            We believe <b>unconfirmed transactions are important</b>. Many merchants want or need to accept payments within seconds rather than minutes or hours. XT accepts this fact and does what it can to minimize the risk, then help sellers judge what remains. It is committed to <a href="http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/8/" title="Satoshi Nakamoto Institute - Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper"> the first seen rule</a>. We will not adopt changes that make unconfirmed transactions riskier.
        lightwallet: |
            <b>Lightweight wallets are important</b>. Most users cannot or will not run a fully verifying node. Most of the world population does not even own a computer: they will experience the internet exclusively via smartphones. These users must sacrifice some security in order to participate, so XT supports whatever technical tradeoffs wallet developers wish to explore.
        decisionmaking: |
            <b>Decision making is quick and clear.</b> Decisions are made according to a leadership hierarchy. The XT software encodes decisions that follow the above principles: people who disagree are welcome to use different software, or patch ours. We do not consider writing principled software to be centralizing and do not refuse to select reasonable defaults.
        professionalism: |
            The Bitcoin XT community is friendly, pragmatic, cares about app developers and considers the user experience in everything we do. We value professionalism in technical approach and communication.

    blocksize:
        title: "Block size hard fork"
        history: |
            Many years ago, a capacity limit was introduced into Bitcoin by Satoshi. He intended it to be removed once lightweight wallets were developed, however, this was never done. As predicted Bitcoin has run out of capacity and users are experiencing reliability problems as a result. The Bitcoin Core developers are unwilling to increase the block chain's capacity, finally this caused the network split into Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Bitcoin (BTC). Miners and users who disagree with them have switched to Bitcoin XT or switched to other clients following the Bitcoin Cash consensus.
        raise: |
            There has been much community debate on this topic. You can read analysis and explanations for why we think raising the block size limit is important here:

    miners:
        title: "Miners"
        vote: |
            By mining with Bitcoin XT you are empowered to <a href="https://bip100.tech">vote on a new maximum block size limit</a>. This indicates to the rest of the network that you support updating the limit. When 75% of the block votes are in agreement, a new limit will automatically activate.
        softlimit: |
            <b>Soft limit</b>: Bitcoin XT supports configuring the maximum size of blocks to mine. When set your node will not create blocks larger than the limit, although it will still accept them.
        nosegwit: |
            Mining is only supported on the Bitcoin Cash network only, as Bitcoin XT does not implement segwit.

    users:
        title: "Users and merchants"
        norisks: |
            By running Bitcoin XT you take no risks: if insufficient mining hash power runs XT to reach supermajority then nothing will happen. If enough does, you will follow the new chain and things will continue as normal.
        doublespend: |
            Additionally, XT has a useful feature: double spend monitoring and relaying. By running XT you help propagate information about double spends across the network, making it harder for payment fraudsters to steal from sellers by broadcasting two conflicting transactions simultaneously.

    explore: "Bitcoin XT has a rich set of features. It's encouraged to explore RPC interface and the <em>--help</em> options."
    somefeatures: "Some selected features of XT"

    features:
      - title: "Dynamic maximum block size by miner vote"
        text: |
            Bitcoin XT implements BIP100, allowing the miners to adjust maximum block size limit after network needs. Read more about it and follow the votes at <a href="https://bip100.tech">bip100.tech</a>
      - title: "Bandwidth limiting"
        text: |
            Set limitations on upload and download bandwidth. This allows you to run a full node without it interfering with other internet services used on your network.
      - title: "Thin block relay"
        text: |
            Bitcoin XT is the only client that supports <em>both</em> the <a href="https://github.com/BitcoinUnlimited/BitcoinUnlimited/blob/release/doc/bu-xthin-protocol.md">XThin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0152.mediawiki">Compact Block</a> protocols. When running XT you will efficiently keep up with the blockchain. You will also help the network by effectively acting as a bridge between nodes that support either protocol, but not both.
      - title: "Double spend relaying"
        text: |
            Detect and help other clients detect double spending transactions. This allows sellers to learn about attempts to defraud them faster and with a lower cost to the peer to peer network. The Bitcoin-Qt wallet will show broadcast double spend attempts in red. There is a new <em>-respendnotify</em> command line flag, and conflicts are reported via the RPC interface. Even if this feature is not needed by you, by running XT you will help those that benefit from it.
      - title: "Support BIP 64 (\"getutxos\")"
        text: |
            This allows peers to request the contents of a ledger entry over the network. It is useful for <a href="https://vinumeris.com/lighthouse" title="Lighthouse - Raise money with Bitcoin">the Lighthouse decentralized crowdfunding wallet</a> to present a better user interface, and for miscellaneous other tasks.
      - title: "Enhanced SPV security"
        text: |
            XT passes onto SPV wallets knowledge about unconfirmed ancestors of transactions, enabling them to better asses the risk of their unconfirmed transactions.
      - title: "Prioritize incoming connections"
        text: |
            It's possible to group IP-addresses of incoming connections and assign them priority. If connection slots become full, then a peer with a lower priority than the incoming connection will be disconnected. As a an anti-DoS measure, Tor exit nodes have optionally lower priority than regular IP addresses as to not reject mobile and home users.

        text: |
            <p>Download and run from our website as normal. Bitcoin XT uses the same data directories and configuration as Bitcoin Core, so if you were previously running that you won't need to download the block chain again. On first run you will need to reindex the blockchain by adding the <em>-reindex</em> switch.</p>

      - id: "why-did-the-xt-fork-happen"
        title: "Why did the Bitcoin XT fork happen?"
        text: |
            <p>Bitcoin XT was created due to a series of fundamental disagreements between Bitcoin core developers. The disagreements revolve around questions like "Should the block chain grow to match user demand?", "What data should the Bitcoin protocol provide to clients?" and "How should technical decisions be made?".</p>
            <p>The biggest and most intractable disagreement is about the block size: the XT community believes the block size must grow in order to support Bitcoin's expanding user base. The Bitcoin Core project has made no move towards increasing the limit, in order to incentivise the creation and use of alternative, non-block chain based financial systems such as the so-called Lightning network. This is an irreconcilable difference of vision that has proven impossible to surmount.</p>
            <p>Additionally, the Bitcoin Core developers have made statements that imply they no longer care about unconfirmed transactions or lightweight peer to peer wallets, although both are relied upon by many users. Without the Bitcoin Cash fork these features would not have remained viable.</p>
            <p>The final area of disagreement is around how decisions are made. Bitcoin Core has no process for resolving disagreements amongst its developers or defining who those developers actually are.</p>
            <p>After a long series of attempts to find compromise in 2015, it became clear that there was no way to resolve these differences except via a fork.</p>

      - id: "hard-fork-alternatives"
        title: "Why can't alternative approaches to the hard fork be used?"
        text: |
            <p>The max block size limit is a rule that every node checks. It was put in as a temporary measure by Satoshi and always intended to be removed, which implies a hard fork as older nodes will reject blocks created by newer nodes. The alternative most heavily promoted is the "Lightning network" by Blockstream, which is an entirely different system: it would require completely different wallets, a replacement for Bitcoin addresses/QR codes, new node software and so on. Lightning posits a set of relationships between quasi-institutional entities that settle up between each other on the block chain from time to time. It is unimplemented and many design elements are not yet defined.</p>
            <p>In short, the only alternative seriously proposed involves abandoning Bitcoin as we know it today and attempting to convince users to move to a largely undesigned and potentially worse alternative.</p>
      - id: "soft-forks"
        title: "Can a soft fork be used instead? Is that better?"
        text: |
            <p>In the case of a block size change, no soft fork is possible because old nodes will realise they are not checking the same rules as soon as they see a block larger than what they are expecting. Any attempts to trick them into believing the 1mb rule is still being followed would require radical modifications to the protocol and major changes to all wallets, which is impractical. Additionally, as old nodes would have to upgrade anyway in order to preserve their security level, there is no benefit to doing a soft fork.</p>
      - id: "who-is-involved"
        title: "How are decisions made?"
        text: |
            <p>Decisions are made by the current maintainer with input from the Bitcoin XT development team. When there is a disagreement the current maintainer will have the final say. If a patch seems in line with the principles of the project it will be considered for inclusion. If the developer is willing to assist with rebasing work, that also helps build the case for inclusion.</p>
