        Bitcoin XT is an implementation of a Bitcoin full node that embraces Bitcoin's original vision of simple, reliable, low-cost transactions for everyone in the world. Bitcoin XT originated as a series of patches on top of Bitcoin Core and is now a independently maintained software fork. See our notable <a href="patches.html">features</a>. We do
        <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinxt/gitian.sigs">deterministic builds</a> so anyone can check the downloads correspond to the <a href="https://github.com/bitcoinxt/bitcoinxt">source code</a>.

        <h2 id="sec-manifesto"><i class="fa fa-compass fa-2x"></i>What we stand for</h2>

        <p>The XT mission statement defines what the project believes is important: commitment to these principles are what differentiates us from Bitcoin Core. We try to follow Satoshi's original vision, as it is that vision which brought the Bitcoin community together.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Scaling the network up to handle user demand is important</b>, even if that means the network
              changes along the way. <a href="http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/2/" title="Satoshi Nakamoto Institute - Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper">It's what
              Satoshi wanted</a> and the idea of a global system used by ordinary people is what motivated many of us to
              join him.
          </li>

          <li><b>XT provides people with information they need</b>, even if using it requires them to make
              risk based decisions. For example:</li>
          <li class="sublist"><ul>
            <li>We believe <b>unconfirmed transactions are important</b>. Many merchants want or need to accept
                payments within seconds rather than minutes or hours. XT accepts this fact and does what it can to
                minimise the risk, then help sellers judge what remains. It is committed to <a href="http://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/emails/cryptography/8/" title="Satoshi Nakamoto Institute - Re: Bitcoin P2P e-cash paper">
                the first seen rule</a>. We will not adopt changes that make unconfirmed transactions riskier.
            </li>
            <li><b>Lightweight wallets are important</b>. Most users cannot or will not run a fully verifying node.
                Most of the world population does not even own a computer: they will experience the internet exclusively
                via smartphones. These users must sacrifice some security in order to participate, so XT supports
                whatever technical tradeoffs wallet developers wish to explore.
            </li>
          </ul></li>

          <li><b>Decision making is quick and clear.</b> Decisions are made according to a leadership hierarchy. The XT
              software encodes decisions that follow the above principles: people who disagree are welcome to use
              different software, or patch ours. We do not consider writing principled software to be centralising
              and do not refuse to select reasonable defaults.
          </li>

          <li>The Bitcoin XT community is friendly, pragmatic, cares about app developers and considers the user
              experience in everything we do. We value professionalism in technical approach and communication.
              We run a moderated mailing list and do not tolerate troublemakers.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="sec-hardfork"><i class="fa fa-gg fa-2x"></i>Block size hard fork</h2>

        <p>
            Many years ago, a capacity limit was introduced into Bitcoin by Satoshi. He intended it to be removed once
            lightweight wallets were developed, however, this was never done. It is expected that soon Bitcoin
            will be out of capacity and <a href="https://medium.com/@octskyward/crash-landing-f5cc19908e32" title="Crash landing — Medium">
            experiencing reliability problems as a result</a>.
            The Bitcoin Core developers are unwilling to increase the block chain's capacity,
            so miners and users who disagree with them must either switch to Bitcoin XT, or switch to other full node clients
            with compatible hard fork consensus, such as <a href="https://bitcoinclassic.com" title="Bitcoin Classic">Bitcoin Classic</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            There has been much community debate on this topic. You can read analysis and explanations for why we think
            raising the block size limit is important here:

        <h2 id="sec-miners"><i class="fa fa-cube fa-2x"></i>Miners</h2>

        <p>
            By mining with Bitcoin XT you will produce blocks with a new version number. This indicates to the rest of
            the network that you support larger blocks. When 75% of the blocks are new-version blocks, a decision
            has been reached to start building larger blocks that will be rejected by Bitcoin Core nodes. At that point
            a waiting period of four weeks begins to allow news of the new consensus to spread and allow anyone who hasn't upgraded yet to do so. During this time, existing Bitcoin Core nodes will be printing a message notifying
            the operators about the availability of an upgraded version.
        </p>

        <p>
            If the hard fork occurs and you are still mining with Bitcoin Core, your node will reject the first new block
            that is larger than one megabyte in size. At that point there is a risk your newly mined coins will not be
            accepted at major exchanges or merchants.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Soft limit</b>: Like Core, Bitcoin XT supports configuring the maximum size of blocks to mine. When set
            your node will not create blocks larger than the limit, although it will still accept them.
        </p>

        <h2 id="sec-users"><i class="fa fa-users fa-2x"></i>Users and merchants</h2>

        <p>
            By running Bitcoin XT you take no risks: if insufficient mining hash power runs XT to reach supermajority
            then nothing will happen. If enough does, you will follow the new chain and things will continue as normal.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, XT has a useful feature: double spend monitoring and relaying. By running XT you help propagate
            information about double spends across the network, making it harder for payment fraudsters to steal from
            sellers by broadcasting two conflicting transactions simultaneously.
